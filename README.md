# L System Implementations 

This project was created to learn more about L-Systems and model them. 
This project aims to implement all the L-System variations found in the following wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system

Python was used as it has a nice package called 'turtle' to visualize L-Systems, by mapping the strings to turtle commands. 

PRs are welcome!
